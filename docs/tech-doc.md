### Project Overview

**Question**: Walk me through your monitoring architecture. What components are you using and why?

**Answer**:
I've built a comprehensive monitoring stack using Prometheus and Grafana for my homelab. The architecture consists of:

• Prometheus (port 9090): Time-series database for metrics collection and storage
• Grafana (port 3000): Visualization layer with custom dashboards
• Node Exporter (port 9100): Collects host system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
• cAdvisor (port 8080): Container performance monitoring

I chose this stack because it's industry-standard, highly scalable, and provides real-time insights into system performance. The configuration is embedded directly in docker-compose.yml using Docker configs, making it fully automated for deployment via Portainer git integration.

### Configuration Management & Deployment

**Question**: How do you handle configuration management and deployment automation?

**Answer**:
I've solved the configuration challenge by embedding the Prometheus configuration directly in the docker-compose.yml file using Docker's configs feature with inline content. This eliminates external file dependencies and makes the deployment fully automated.

The key innovation is using:

```yaml
configs:
  prometheus_config:
    content: |
      global:
        scrape_interval: 15s
      # ... entire config embedded here
```

This approach works perfectly with Portainer's git deployment because there are no external files to copy or mount. Everything is self-contained and version-controlled.

### Monitoring Targets & Service Discovery

**Question**: What monitoring targets are you currently scraping, and how would you add new services?

**Answer**:
Currently monitoring:

• Prometheus itself (localhost:9090) - Self-monitoring
• Node Exporter (node-exporter:9100) - Host metrics
• cAdvisor (cadvisor:8080) - Container metrics
• Grafana (grafana:3000) - Application metrics
• Synology NAS (192.168.1.131:3001) - Ready for node-exporter

To add new services, I'd add a new scrape job in the embedded Prometheus config:

```yaml
- job_name: 'new-service'
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['new-service:port']
  scrape_interval: 30s
```

Then update the stack in Portainer. The configuration is version-controlled, so changes are tracked and reversible.

### Data Persistence & Retention Strategy

**Question**: How do you handle data persistence and what's your retention strategy?

**Answer**:
I use Docker volumes for data persistence:

• prometheus-data: Stores time-series data
• grafana-data: Stores dashboard configurations and user data

For retention, I've configured Prometheus with --storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d, which keeps 30 days of metrics data. This balances storage usage with historical analysis needs.

The volumes are managed by Docker and persist across container restarts. For backup, I could easily backup the volume data or implement a backup strategy for the Synology NAS.

### Challenges & Solutions

**Question**: What challenges did you face during setup, and how did you solve them?

**Answer**:
The main challenge was making the deployment fully automated for Portainer git integration. Initially, I had external configuration files that needed to be copied to the NAS, which broke the automation.

**Problems encountered:**
1. Bind mount failures: External config files didn't exist during git deployment
2. Permission issues: Docker commands not available in user context
3. Port conflicts: Multiple services trying to use the same ports

**Solutions implemented:**
1. Embedded configuration: Used Docker configs with inline content
2. Self-contained deployment: No external file dependencies
3. Port management: Carefully planned port allocation (3000, 8080, 9090, 9100)

The result is a production-ready monitoring stack that deploys automatically from git with zero manual intervention.

### Data Retention & Deletion Process

**Question**: How does Prometheus handle data retention and deletion?

**Answer**:
Prometheus uses a built-in Time Series Database (TSDB) with automatic garbage collection. Here's how it works:

**Data Structure:**
```
/prometheus/
├── wal/                                    ← Write-Ahead Log (recent data)
├── 01K7N1METCBEHK94Y0X5PKRWZN/chunks/     ← Data block 1
├── 01K7NP7G3FXX77PARR0R8JPJSN/chunks/     ← Data block 2
└── ... (more blocks)
```

**Deletion Process:**
• No external scripts - Built into Prometheus core
• Block-based deletion - Removes entire 2-hour data blocks
• Automatic process - Runs continuously in background
• After 30 days - Old blocks are automatically deleted
• Rolling window - Always keeps the most recent 30 days

**Retention Configuration:**
```yaml
command:
  - '--storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d'  # 30 days retention
```

### cAdvisor Metrics & Queries

**Question**: How do you monitor container performance with cAdvisor?

**Answer**:
cAdvisor provides comprehensive container metrics. Here are key queries I use:

**Container Health:**
```promql
up{job="cadvisor"}
```

**Total Running Containers:**
```promql
count(container_last_seen{name!=""})
```

**Top 5 CPU Usage:**
```promql
topk(5, rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{name!=""}[5m]) * 100)
```

**Memory Usage:**
```promql
container_memory_usage_bytes{name!=""} / 1024 / 1024
```

**Network I/O:**
```promql
rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{name!=""}[5m])
```

### Grafana Dashboard Management

**Question**: How do you manage and version control your Grafana dashboards?

**Answer**:
I store dashboard JSON files in the git repository under monitoring/grafana/dashboards/:

**Dashboard Files:**
• container-monitoring-dashboard.json - cAdvisor metrics
• synology-nas-dashboard-new.json - NAS-specific monitoring
• rag-stack-dashboard.json - Application monitoring

**Benefits:**
• Version controlled - Track changes over time
• Auto-provisioned - Loads automatically with stack
• Team collaboration - Others can see dashboard config
• Backup - Safely stored in git

**Dashboard Types:**
• Stat panels - Single values (CPU usage, memory)
• Time series - Historical trends
• Tables - Top N lists
• Gauges - Percentage displays

### Service Discovery & Access

**Question**: How do you manage access to multiple services?

**Answer**:
I use a service discovery approach with memorable URLs:

**Service URLs:**
• Grafana: http://192.168.1.131:3000 (Monitoring dashboards)
• Prometheus: http://192.168.1.131:9090 (Metrics collection)
• cAdvisor: http://192.168.1.131:8080 (Container metrics)

**For better service management, I recommend:**
• Heimdall Dashboard - Service discovery portal
• Homer Dashboard - Lightweight service directory
• Organizr - Full-featured dashboard with authentication
